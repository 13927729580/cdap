================================================================================

BigFlow Developer Edition is a fully functioning stand alone edition of the
Continuuity BigFlow platform. You can use this edition to write, debug and test
your BigData applications, before deploying to the Continuuity Cloud Platform.

Installation
============

To install and use BigFlow and the included examples there are a few simple
pre-requisite requirements:

  1. Java 1.6+ (required to run BigFlow, note: $JAVA_HOME should be set)
  2. Node.js 0.8.1+ (required to run the BigFlow UI)
  3. Ant 1.8+ (required to build the example applications)

Once you have installed the prerequisites, you should unzip the BigFlow
distribution to a suitable directory. E.g.

  %> cd ~/Projects
  %> unzip /tmp/bigflow-developer-edition-1.0.0-alpha.zip

You are now ready to start BigFlow. Do so by running the 'bigflow' script in
the $BIGFLOW_DIR/bin folder. E.g.

  %> cd ~/Projects/bigflow-developer-edition-1.0.0-alpha
  %> bin/bigflow
