Loom |release| Documentation
===========================

Continuuity Loom is a system that enables users to provision clusters, based on templates and settings defined by its
administrators. Loom exposes simple interfaces for administrators to flexibly customize the properties of provisioned
clusters, including software services, hardware configurations and infrastructure providers.

This documentation provides information about Loom, its operational management capabilities, and its functionality for both end users and
system administrators. The document presumes you have some familiarity with the SQL databases, Zookeeper, and have working knowledge of the REST protocol and Ruby programming language.
