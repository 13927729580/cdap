Continuuity Loom (TM) - A cloud based cluster provisioning
system supporting basic operations like create, delete, amend, update.
Continuuity Loom provisions Hadoop clusters in less
than 10 minutes and drastically reduces startup time for
MapReduce jobs and other Big Data applications.

Cluster management is one of the fastest growing and most complex areas of Big
Data. Continuuity Loom is the next- generation provisioning, management,
monitoring, metering and elastic scaling software for any type of cluster.
It’s easy, fast and secure to manage cluster lifecycle right from a developer
workstation, whether the cluster is physical, virtual or in the cloud.
Loom gives developers and operations control by delivering frictionless ways
to provision and manage clusters. No more filing tickets or fighting to
configure complicated clusters. It allows developers to go from zero to a
working cluster in less than 10 minutes. Loom makes developers, system
administrators and IT more productive than ever.

Highlights and Features
=======================

Core Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
• Customize and manage clusters throughout the full cluster lifecycle.
• Monitor and meter cluster resources on both private and public clouds.
• Integrate with any infrastructure provider including OpenStack.

• On-demand Hadoop cluster provisioning
• Scalability to hundreds of clusters
• Atomic cluster operations
• Seamless integration with OpenStack and IaaS providers
• Flexible storage and compute models (VM, KVM, LXC)
• Pluggable automation platform (e.g. Chef, Puppet)
• Cluster management across datacenters
• Monitoring and integration with Ganglia

Full Lifecycle Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Loom allows developers to scale-up or scale-down clusters using the
Loom UI and command line tools. Users are also able to upgrade, downgrade
and install new software on to an existing cluster.

Reduced IT Overhead
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In many organizations, developers submit requests to access a Hadoop cluster
in order to run a MapReduce job. With Loom, the IT department sets up a
catalog of clusters that can be provisioned directly by developers. Developers
can allocate, scale or destroy a cluster directly from their workstation.
Instant access to IT resources reduces wait time and increases productivity.

Monitoring and Alerting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Loom provides a centralized dashboard to monitor and manage multiple clusters
concurrently. IT operations can centralize logs, custom metrics and alerts for
instant remediation of critical issues. Integration with Ganglia and Hadoop
metrics is seamless.

Multiple Datacenters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Loom provides a unified view of all data center capacity and allows
provisioning clusters across multiple data centers based on developer
preference and resource availability.

Private and Public Clouds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Loom integrates easily with OpenStack for behind-the- firewall cluster
provisioning and management. It also works with any IaaS provider in the
public cloud.

Seamless Enterprise Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Loom simplifies the installation and configuration of any software stack,
including Hadoop, and ensures that all installations are verified before they
are made available. Loom also integrates seamlessly with existing LDAP
installations to enforce user permissions and with existing IT operations
databases to manage network resources.

Extensibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Manage any Big Data application through open source automation platform Chef.
Many Chef recipes are readily available and you can also develop your own.

REST APIs and a Rich UI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Integrate with existing tools and workflows via the Loom REST API. Loom also
provides an intuitive UI that allows users to create and manage clusters.
