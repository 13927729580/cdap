Loom is a cluster provisioning system designed with the intent of 
supporting complex clusters lifecycle management within public 
and private clouds. Loom exposes seperate interfaces for creating 
complex cluster templates while keeping it simple for users to 
create instances of template. Loom is designed bottom up with the cluster
as the basic element for creation, deletion, amend, update & monitoring. 
Loom was designed to simplify and unify the
process of cluster provisioning across infrastructure systems,
while still allowing the flexibility to individually
specify cluster settings.

Loom streamlines the process of cluster provisioning, reducing
the amount of work necessary for system administrators and developers within a IT organization.
Loom also allows cluster adminstrators to more easily manage and
monitor clusters through a higher level interface system.

Who needs Loom ?
====================

Cluster management is one of the fastest growing and most complex areas of Big
Data. Continuuity Loom is the next-generation provisioning, management,
monitoring, metering and elastic scaling software for any type of cluster.
It’s easy, fast and secure to manage cluster lifecycle right from a developer
workstation, whether the cluster is physical, virtual or in the cloud.
Loom gives developers and operations control by delivering frictionless ways
to provision and manage clusters. No more filing tickets or fighting to
configure complicated clusters. It allows developers to go from zero to a
working cluster in less than 10 minutes. Loom makes developers, system
administrators and IT more productive than ever. 

Loom can also be used in a cloud environment for providing higher order 
services to end users. Rather than talking in terms of individual machines, Loom 
talks in terms of clusters and services. Current and future problems will 
be more focused around not manging individual machines, but more around managing 
clusters of machines or clusters of cluster.

History of Loom
===============

Loom came out of the problem that we were facing within Continuuity in terms of 


• Customize and manage clusters throughout the full cluster lifecycle.
• Monitor and meter cluster resources on both private and public clouds.
• Integrate with any infrastructure provider including OpenStack.

For a list of features, see the :ref:`Features <features>` page.
