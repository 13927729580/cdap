Why Do I Need Loom?
====================

Cluster management is one of the fastest growing and most complex areas of Big
Data. Continuuity Loom is the next-generation provisioning, management,
monitoring, metering and elastic scaling software for any type of cluster.
It’s easy, fast and secure to manage cluster lifecycle right from a developer
workstation, whether the cluster is physical, virtual or in the cloud.
Loom gives developers and operations control by delivering frictionless ways
to provision and manage clusters. No more filing tickets or fighting to
configure complicated clusters. It allows developers to go from zero to a
working cluster in less than 10 minutes. Loom makes developers, system
administrators and IT more productive than ever.
