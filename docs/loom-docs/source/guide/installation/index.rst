.. _installation-repository:
Installing from Repository
==========================

Access to the Continuuity private repository is required for package installation.

Yum
---
To add the Continuuity Yum repository, add the following content to the file ``/etc/yum.repos.d/continuuity.repo``:
::
  [continuuity]
  name=Continuuity Releases
  baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@repository.continuuity.com/content/groups/restricted
  enabled=1
  protect=0
  gpgcheck=0
  metadata_expire=30s
  autorefresh=1
  type=rpm-md

.. note:: username and password should be url encoded

Instructions for installing each of the Loom components are as below:
::
  # Loom Server
  yum install loom-server

  #Loom Provisioner
  yum install loom-provisioner

  #Loom UI
  yum install loom-ui

Debian
------
To add the Continuuity Debian repository, add the following content to the file ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/continuuity.list``:
::
  deb     [arch=amd64] https://<username>:<password>@repository.continuuity.com/content/sites/apt precise release

Instructions for installing each of the Loom components are as below:
::
  # Loom Server
  apt-get install loom-server

  #Loom Provisioner
  apt-get install loom-provisioner

  #Loom UI
  apt-get install loom-ui

Database Configuration
----------------------
By default, Loom uses an embedded Derby database. However, you can optionally choose to enable remote database for Loom server.
Additional steps are required to configure this setting.

**Download and add the database connector JAR**

Execute the following command on the Loom server machine:

For RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux:
::
  yum install mysql-connector-java*
For SLES:
::
  zypper install mysql-connector-java*
For Ubuntu:
::
  apt-get install mysql-connector-java*

After the install, the MySQL JAR is placed in ``/usr/share/java/``. Copy the downloaded JAR file to the
``/opt/loom/server/lib/`` directory on your Loom server machine. Verify that the JAR file has appropriate permissions.

You will need to set up an account and a database in MySQL. An example schema file (for MySQL) for this can be found at
``/opt/loom/server/docs/sql``.

.. note:: after installing the mysql connector, the java version may change.  Make sure you are using java 1.6 from oracle.  You may need to run update-alternatives --config java to do this.

Loom server Configuration
-------------------------

Loom server settings can be changed under the ``/etc/loom/conf/loom-site.xml`` configuration file. For a list of
available configurations, see the :doc:`Server Configuration </guide/admin/server-config>` page.

.. _common-issues:
Common Installation Issues
==========================

A common issue is installing Loom on machines that have Open JDK installed rather than Oracle JDK.
Loom currently does not support Open JDK.
