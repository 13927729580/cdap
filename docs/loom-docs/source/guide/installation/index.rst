.. _installation-file:
Installing from File
====================

Yum
---
To install each of the Loom components locally from a Yum package:
::
  $ sudo yum localinstall loom-server-<version>-<revision>.el6.x86_64.rpm
  $ sudo yum localinstall loom-provisioner-<version>-<revision>.el6.x86_64.rpm
  $ sudo yum localinstall loom-ui-<version>-<revision>.el6.x86_64.rpm


Debian
------
To install each of the Loom components locally from a Debian package:
::
  $ sudo dpkg -i loom-server_<version>-<revision>.ubuntu.12.04_amd64.deb
  $ sudo dpkg -i loom-provisioner_<version>-<revision>.ubuntu.12.04_amd64.deb
  $ sudo dpkg -i loom-ui_<version>-<revision>.ubuntu.12.04_amd64.deb

.. _installation-repository:
Installing from Repository
==========================

Access to the Continuuity private repository is required for package installation.

Yum
---
To add the Continuuity Yum repository, add the following content to the file ``/etc/yum.repos.d/continuuity.repo``:
::
  [continuuity]
  name=Continuuity Releases
  baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@repository.continuuity.com/content/groups/restricted
  enabled=1
  protect=0
  gpgcheck=0
  metadata_expire=30s
  autorefresh=1
  type=rpm-md

.. note:: Username and password should be url encoded.

Instructions for installing each of the Loom components are as below:
::
  $ sudo yum install loom-server
  $ sudo yum install loom-provisioner
  $ sudo yum install loom-ui

Debian
------
To add the Continuuity Debian repository, add the following content to the file ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/continuuity.list``:
::
  deb     [arch=amd64] https://<username>:<password>@repository.continuuity.com/content/sites/apt precise release

Instructions for installing each of the Loom components are as below:
::
  $ sudo apt-get install loom-server
  $ sudo apt-get install loom-provisioner
  $ sudo apt-get install loom-ui

Database Configuration
----------------------
By default, Loom uses an embedded Derby database. However, you can optionally choose to enable remote database for Loom server.
Additional steps are required to configure this setting.

**Download and add the database connector JAR**

Execute the following command on the Loom server machine:

For RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux:
::
  $ sudo yum install mysql-connector-java*
For SLES:
::
  $ sudo zypper install mysql-connector-java*
For Ubuntu:
::
  $ sudo apt-get install mysql-connector-java*

After the install, the MySQL JAR is placed in ``/usr/share/java/``. Copy the downloaded JAR file to the
``/opt/loom/server/lib/`` directory on your Loom server machine. Verify that the JAR file has appropriate permissions.

.. note:: After installing the MySQL connector, the Java version may change.  Make sure you are using Java 1.6 from Oracle.  You may need to run ``update-alternatives --config java`` to do this.

You will need to set up an account and a database in MySQL. An example schema file (for MySQL) for this can be found at
``/opt/loom/server/docs/sql``.

If you are setting up a MySQL database from scratch you can run the following on your mysql machine to complete the database setup:
::
  $ mysql -u root -p<root-password> -e 'create database loom;'
  $ mysql -u root -p<root-password> -e 'grant all privileges on loom.* to "loom"@"%" identified by "<password>";'
  $ mysql -u loom -p<password> loom < /opt/loom/server/docs/sql/loom-<version>-create-tables-mysql.sql
  $ mysql -u loom -p<password> loom -e 'show tables;'
  +----------------+
  | Tables_in_loom |
  +----------------+
  | clusters       |
  | jobs           |
  | nodes          |
  | tasks          |
  +----------------+

where loom.sql is the example schema file at ``/opt/loom/server/docs/sql``, and where passwords are replaced as needed. 

Loom server Configuration
-------------------------

Loom server settings can be changed under the ``/etc/loom/conf/loom-site.xml`` configuration file. For a list of
available configurations, see the :doc:`Server Configuration </guide/admin/server-config>` page.


.. _setting-environmental-variables:
Setting Environmental Variables
===============================

Several environmental variables can be set in Loom Provisioner and Loom UI.

Loom Server
-----------
The Server environmental variables can be set at ``/etc/default/loom-server``. The configurable variables are as below:

.. list-table::

   * - Variable
     - Default
     - Description
   * - ``LOOM_LOG_DIR``
     - /var/log/loom
     - Path for the log directory

Loom Provisioner
----------------
The Provisioner environmental variables can be set at ``/etc/default/loom-provisioner``. The configurable variables are as below:

.. list-table::

   * - Variable
     - Default
     - Description
   * - ``LOOM_NUM_WORKERS``
     - 5
     - The number of provisioner workers spawned
   * - ``LOOM_LOG_DIR``
     - /var/log/loom
     - Path for the log directory
   * - ``LOOM_SERVER_URI``
     - http://localhost:55054
     - The URI for Loom Server


Loom UI
-------
The UI environmental variables can be set at ``/etc/default/loom-ui``. The configurable variables are as below:

.. list-table::

   * - Variable
     - Default
     - Description
   * - ``LOOM_LOG_DIR``
     - /var/log/loom
     - Path for the log directory
   * - ``LOOM_SERVER_URI``
     - http://localhost:55054
     - The URI for Loom Server


Loading Default Templates
=========================

Loom provides a set of useful defaults, which cover a majority of basic use cases and act as starting points for template
definition. Preloading these defaults is generally recommended for beginners of Loom, and are required
for running the example in the :doc:`Quick Start Guide </guide/quickstart/index>`. To load these templates, run:
::
  $ sudo /opt/loom/server/docs/examples/loaddefaults.sh

.. _common-issues:
Common Installation Issues
==========================

A common issue is installing Loom on machines that have Open JDK installed rather than Oracle JDK.
Loom currently does not support Open JDK.

.. _starting_stopping:
Starting and Stopping Loom Services
===================================
By default, the Loom's installation rpms and pkgs do not configure auto start of the services in the ``init.d``. We leave 
that privilege to the administrator. For each Loom component and its related service (such as the Server, Provisioner, and UI), 
there is a launch script, which you may use to execute a desired operation. For example, to start, stop, or check status 
for a Loom provisioner, you can use:
::
  $ sudo /etc/init.d/loom-server start|stop
  $ sudo /etc/init.d/loom-provisioner start|stop|status
  $ sudo /etc/init.d/loom-ui start|stop
