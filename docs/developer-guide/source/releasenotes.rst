New Application, Stream, Flowlet, and Dataset Features
======================================================
- New Application API with an easier and cleaner way to define application components
- Stream support for retention policy for its data; configurable at runtime, 
  while the Stream is in use
- Stream truncate support via REST
- Simplified Flowlet ``@Batch`` support: process methods don't require an ``Iterator`` as a parameter
- New Datasets API that exposes low level APIs to give more power & flexibility for developing custom
  Dataset types; flexible dataset types configuration
- Datasets types management outside of applications: a REST interface to add, remove, and discover
  Dataset types
- Datasets management outside of application: a REST interface to create, truncate, drop and discover
  Datasets

New Ad-hoc Querying Feature
===========================
- Reactor now supports ad-hoc SQL queries over Datasets
- A new API that allows developers to expose the schema of the Dataset and make it query able
- A new REST API to submit SQL queries and retrieve the results

New Security Features
=====================
- Reactor now supports perimeter security, restricting access to resources to only authenticated users
- With ``security.enabled=true``, users must then login in order to access the Reactor UI
- Access to all Reactor REST APIs can be secured by an ``OAuth 2`` Bearer token, which is obtained by
  authentication with the Reactor authentication service using a pluggable mechanism
- The Reactor authentication service supports authentication via either LDAP or a JASPI plugin 
  out of the  box and can be extended to other mechanisms through a simple plug-in API
- Access to the Reactor authentication service can be secured by enabling SSL support

New Reactor Services Features
=============================
- Reactor application now supports adding Custom User Services Â 
- Custom user services can be discovered from Flows, Procedures and MapReduce jobs
- The number of user service instances can be scaled
