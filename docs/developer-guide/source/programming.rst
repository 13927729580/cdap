For example::	PUT /v2/streams/<new-stream-id>indicates that the text ``<new-stream-id>`` is a variable and that you are to replace it with your value,perhaps in this case *mystream*::	PUT /v2/streams/mystreamProgramming APIs================Application-----------Collect-------Streams.......Process-------			Flows.....MapReduce.........Workflows.........Store-----DataSets........Query-----Procedures..........Testing [rev 2]===============Strategies in testing applications----------------------------------Unit testing------------Local Continuuity Reactor-------------------------.. include:: includes/footer.rst
