What is a Reactor?
------------------
Continuuity Reactorâ„¢ is a Java-based middleware solution that abstracts the complexities and integrates the components of the Hadoop ecosystem (YARN, MapReduce, HBase, Zookeeper, etc.). Simply stated, Reactor behaves like a modern-day application server, distributed and scalable, sitting on top of a Hadoop distribution (such as CDH, HDP, or Apache). It provides a programming framework and scalable runtime environment that allows any Java developer to build Big Data applications without having to understand all of the details of Hadoop.

We've recently observed longer delays because of an unexpected high demand during peak hours, provisioning taking up to 30 minutes has been observed. Sandbox creation can take several minutes. If no confirmation is received within anhour, please contact `support <https://continuuity.uservoice.com/clients/widgets/classic_widget?mode=support&link_color=162e52&primary_color=42afcf&embed_type=lightbox&trigger_method=custom_trigger&contact_enabled=true&feedback_enabled=false&smartvote=true&referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.continuuity.com%2Fdevelopers#contact_us>`_
