What is a Continuuity Reactor?
------------------------------
Continuuity Reactorâ„¢ is a Java-based middleware solution that abstracts the complexities and integrates the components of the Hadoop ecosystem (YARN, MapReduce, HBase, Zookeeper, etc.). Simply stated, Reactor behaves like a modern-day application server: distributed, scalable, sitting on top of a Hadoop distribution such as CDH, HDP, or Apache. It provides a programming framework and scalable runtime environment that allows any Java developer to build Big Data applications without having to understand all of the details of Hadoop.

What is available in the Continuuity SDK?
-----------------------------------------
Continuuity SDK comes with:

- Java and REST APIs to build Continuuity Reactor applications;
- Local Reactor to run the entire Reactor stack in a single Java virtual machine; and
- Example Reactor applications.

What Platforms are Supported by the Continuuity SDK?
----------------------------------------------------
The Development Kit can be run on Mac OS X, Linux or Windows platforms.

What Version of Java SDK is Required by the Continuuity SDK?
------------------------------------------------------------
The latest version of the JDK or JRE version 6 must be installed in your environment. Only Java6 is currently supported.

What Version of Node.JS is Required by the Continuuity SDK?
------------------------------------------------------------
The version of Node.js must be v0.8.16 or greater.

What is a Sandbox Reactor?
--------------------------
A Sandbox Reactor is a self-service Continuuity Reactor to deploy, manage and monitor Reactor applications in the cloud. A Sandbox Reactor is deployed on a single instance, hosted by Continuuity.com and available for 30 days for free. 

How do I Get a Sandbox Reactor?
-------------------------------
Anyone who wishes to get a Sandbox Reactor can signup with `Continuuity <https://accounts.continuuity.com/signup>`_ and provision a Sandbox Reactor for 30 days.

How Long Does It Take to Provision a Sandbox Reactor?
-----------------------------------------------------
Sandbox creation can take several minutes. The normal time is between ten to twenty minutes but time varies based on how many users are provisioning at a given time. We've recently observed longer delays because of high demand during peak hours; provisioning taking up to 30 minutes has been observed. If no confirmation is received within an hour, please contact `Continuuity support`__.

Is My Sandbox Reactor Accessible or Visible to Other Users?

What Happens to My Sandbox Reactor After the 30-day Trial?

The Sandbox Reactor will be deleted along with any application and data that is stored during the 30-day trial. Continuuity does not backup the applications that are deployed or the data that is stored.
