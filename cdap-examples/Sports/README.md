# Sports example

Example application that illustrates PartitionedFileSet datasets using sports results.

Features introduced: Partitioned file sets, MapReduce with runtime arguments, Ad-hoh queries over file sets.

- Uses a partitioned file set to store game results. It is partitioned by league and season, and ech partition
  is a file containing the results of one league for ine season, for example the 2014 season of the NFL.
- Results are uploaded into the file set using a service.
- The results can be explored using ad-hoc SQL queries.
- A MapReduce program reads all results for one league and aggregates total counts across all seasons, and writes
  these to another partitioned table that is partitioned only by league.
- The totals can also be queried using ad-hoc SQL.
