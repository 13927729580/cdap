   Binary Zip File <zip>
   Virtual Machine Image <virtual-machine>
   Docker Image <docker>

There are three ways to download the CDAP SDK: 

- as a :doc:`binary zip file <zip>`;
- as a :doc:`Virtual Machine image <virtual-machine>`; or 
- as a :doc:`Docker image <docker>`.

If you already have a development environment setup, the zip file is your easiest solution.

If you don't have a development environment, the Virtual Machine offers a pre-configured
environment with CDAP pre-installed and that automatically starts applications so that you
can be productive immediately. You can build your own projects or follow the provided
example applications.

The Docker image is intended for those developing on Linux.
