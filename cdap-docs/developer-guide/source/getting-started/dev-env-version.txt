Creating an Application
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The best way to start developing a CDAP application is by using the Maven archetype::

   $ mvn archetype:generate \
     -DarchetypeGroupId=co.cask.cdap \
     -DarchetypeArtifactId=cdap-app-archetype \
     -DarchetypeVersion=<version>

This creates a Maven project with all required dependencies, Maven plugins, and a simple
application template for the development of your application. You can import this Maven project
into your preferred IDE—such as Eclipse or IntelliJ—and start developing your first
CDAP application.
