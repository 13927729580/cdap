The CDAP Software Development Kit (SDK) is all that is needed to develop CDAP applications
in your development environment, either your laptop or a work station. It includes:

- A Standalone CDAP that can run on a single machine in a single JVM. It provides all of
  the CDAP APIs without requiring a Hadoop cluster, using alternative, fully functional
  implementations of CDAP features. For example, application containers are implemented as
  Java threads instead of YARN containers.
- The :ref:`CDAP Console, <cdap-console>` a web-based graphical user interface to interact with CDAP instances
  and the applications they run.
- A set of :ref:`tools, <tools>` datasets and :ref:`example applications <examples-index>`
  to help you become familiar with CDAP, and serve as templates for developing your
  own applications.
  
Online, we have many additional resources, ranging from this extensive documentation set
to user groups.
