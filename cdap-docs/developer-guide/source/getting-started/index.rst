The CDAP Software Development Kit (SDK) is all that is needed to develop CDAP applications
in your development environment, either your laptop or a work station. It includes:

- A Standalone CDAP that can run on a single machine in a single JVM. It provides all of
  the CDAP APIs without requiring a Hadoop cluster, using alternative, fully functional
  implementations of CDAP features. For example, application containers are implemented as
  Java threads instead of YARN containers.
- The :doc:`CDAP Console, </user-interface>` a web-based graphical user interface to interact with the Standalone CDAP
  and the applications it runs.
- A set of tools, datasets and example applications that help you get familiar with CDAP, and
  can also serve as templates for developing your own applications.
  
.. - The complete CDAP documentation, including this document and the Javadocs for the CDAP APIs.
