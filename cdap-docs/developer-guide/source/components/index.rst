This section covers the two core virtualizations in the Cask Data Application Platform
(CDAP) — Data and Applications. Data virtualizations are grouped into Streams and
Datasets. Application virtualizations are grouped into Flows, MapReduce, Spark, Workflows,
and Services. This section details how to work with these abstractions to build Big Data
applications.

For a high-level view of the concepts of the Cask Data Application Platform,
please see :doc:`Concepts and Architecture </arch>`.

For more information beyond this section, see the :doc:`Javadocs </javadocs/index>` and
the code in the :ref:`Examples <examples>` directory, both of which are on the `Cask.co
<http://cask.co>`_ `resources page <http://cask.co/resources>`_ as well as in your CDAP
installation directory.
