==================================================
Introduction to the Cask Data Application Platform
==================================================

The Cask |(TM)| Data Application Platform (CDAP) is an open source project for distributed data
and applications. CDAP is a layer of software running on top of Hadoop platforms such as the
Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub or the Hortonworks Data Platform. CDAP provides 3 essential functions:

- Virtualization of data in the Hadoop environment by creating logical representations of underlying
  data
- Virtualization of applications by creating application containers
- Services and tools that enable faster application creation in development and higher degrees of
  operational control in production

CDAP exposes developer APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), both for creating applications
and accessing core CDAP services. CDAP defines and implements a collection of services that land
applications and data on existing Hadoop infrastructure such as HBase, HDFS, YARN, MapReduce,
Hive, and Spark.

This document is your complete guide to the Cask Data Application Platform: It helps you get
started and set up your development environment; it explains how CDAP works and teaches how to
develop and test application with CDAP, or how to virtualize an existing Hadoop application.
It also contains a complete reference of CDAP programming APIs and client interfaces.
Furthermore, this document describes how to install, monitor and diagnose a fully distributed
CDAP in a Hadoop cluster.


Where to Go Next
================
Now that you've had an introduction to CDAP, take a look at:

- :ref:`get-started`,
  which guides you through installing the CDAP SDK, setting up your development environment,
  and building and running an example application.
