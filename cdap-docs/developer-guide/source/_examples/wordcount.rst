Word Count
----------

A Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) Example demonstrating Flows, Datasets and Procedures.

Overview
........

This application receives words and sentences from a stream and uses flowlets to process them and
store the results and stats in datasets.

  - The ``wordStream`` receives sends the received sentences to the flowlet ``splitter``
  - The ``splitter`` flowlet splits the received sentence into words, writes global stats of the received words like "total words received"
    and "total length of words received" and emits each word to the flowlet ``counter`` and the sentence (list of words)
    to the flowlet ``associator``
  - The ``associator`` flowlet receives the set of words and writes word association to the dataset,
    Example: If we recevie a sentence "welcome to CDAP", there would be word associations for
    {"welcome","to"} , {"welcome", "CDAP"}, and {"welcome","to}
  - The ``counter`` flowlet receives a word and increments the count for this word, maintained in a Key-Value table and forwards this word to ``unique`` flowlet
  - The ``unique`` flowlet receives a word and updates the UniqueCountTable if we are seeing this word for the first time.

Let's look at some of these elements, and then run the Application and see the results.

The Word Count Application
..........................

As in the other `examples <index.html>`__, the components
of the Application are tied together by the class ``WordCount``::

  public class WordCount extends AbstractApplication {
    @Override
    public void configure() {
      setName("WordCount");
      setDescription("Example Word Count Application");

      // Ingest data into the Application via Streams
      addStream(new Stream("wordStream"));

       // Store processed data in Datasets
      createDataset("wordStats", Table.class);
      createDataset("wordCounts", KeyValueTable.class);
      createDataset("uniqueCount", UniqueCountTable.class);
      createDataset("wordAssocs", AssociationTable.class);

      // Process events in real-time using Flows
      addFlow(new WordCounter());

      // Query the processed data using a Procedure
      addProcedure(new RetrieveCounts());
    }
  }


Data Storage
++++++++++++

- The wordStats table stores the global stats of total count of words and the total length of words received
- The wordCounts table stores the word and the corresponding count in a key value table.
- The UniqueCountTable is a custom dataset, that stores the total count of unique words received so far
- The AssociationTable is a custom dataset, that stores the count for word associations.

RetrieveCounts Procedure
++++++++++++++++++++++++

This Procedure has three methods,
  - getStats(): Returns global stats like get total words received, total length of words received and the average length of words.
  - getCount(): Given a word, this would return the total count of occurrence and the top-10 associated words for this word.
  - getAssoc(): Given a pair, "word1" and "word2" this would return the association count for this pair

Setting Up
++++++++++
#. You can find instructions for starting CDAP console and deploying an example application here :ref:`Build, Deploy and start <convention>`
#. Once loaded, select the ``WordCount`` Application from the list.
   On the Application's detail page, click the *Start* button on **both** the *Process* and *Query* lists.

Running the Example
+++++++++++++++++++

Injecting Sentences
###################

In the Application's detail page, under Process, click on WordCounter flow. This takes you to the flow details page.
Now click on the "WordStream" stream on the left side of the flow visualization, which brings up a pop-up window.
Enter a sentence "Hello CDAP" and click on the Inject button. After you close the pop-up window, you will see that the counter
for the stream increase to 1. while the counters for the flowlets ``splitter and associator`` increase to 1 and
``counter and unique`` increases to 2.
You can repeat this step to enter more sentences.

Querying the Results
####################

If the Procedure has not already been started, you start it either through the
CDAP Console or via an HTTP request using the ``curl`` command::

	curl -v -X POST 'http://localhost:10000/v2/apps/WordCount/procedures/RetrieveCounts/start'

There are two ways to query the  ``RetrieveCounts`` procedure:

1. Send a query via an HTTP request using the ``curl`` command. For example::

	curl -v -d '{"word": "CDAP"}' \
	  -X POST 'http://localhost:10000/v2/apps/WordCount/procedures/RetrieveCounts/methods/getCount'

  On Windows, a copy of ``curl`` is located in the ``libexec`` directory of the project SDK::

	  libexec\curl...

2. Click on the ``RetrieveCounts`` in the Application page of the Console to get to the
   Procedure dialogue. Type in the method name ``getCount``, and enter the word in the parameters
   field, such as::

	  { "word" : "CDAP" }

Then click the *Execute* button. The word count and top-10 associations words for the input word will be displayed in the
Console in JSON format, for example [reformatted to fit]::

  {
    "assocs": {
        "Hello": 1
    },
    "count": 1,
    "word": "CDAP"
  }

3. You can try executing other methods available in this procedure,
    - getStats
    - getAssoc - For getAssoc you need to provide two words to get their association count, Example: {"word1":"Hello", "word2":"CDAP"}
