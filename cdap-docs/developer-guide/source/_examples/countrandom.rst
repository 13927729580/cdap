Count Random
------------

A Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) Example demonstrating Flows.

Overview
........

This application does not have a Stream, instead it has a Generator Flowlet ``source``
  - The ``source`` flowlet has a ``@Tick`` annotation which specifies how frequent this flowlet will be called.
  - The ``source`` flowlet generates a random integer in the range {1..10000} and emits it to the next flowlet ``splitter``
  - The ``splitter`` flowlet splits the number into digits, and emits these digits to the next stage
  - The ``counter`` increments the count of the received number in the KeyValueTable.

Let's look at some of these elements, and then run the Application and see the results.

The Count Random Application
............................

As in the other `examples <index.html>`__, the components
of the Application are tied together by the class ``CountRandom``::

  public class CountRandom extends AbstractApplication {

    public static final String TABLE_NAME = "randomTable";

    @Override
    public void configure() {
      setName("CountRandom");
      setDescription("Example random count application");
      createDataset(TABLE_NAME, KeyValueTable.class);
      addFlow(new CountRandomFlow());
    }
  }

The Generator Flowlet that generates Random numbers every 1 millisecond::

  public class RandomSource extends AbstractFlowlet {
    private OutputEmitter<Integer> randomOutput;

    private final Random random = new Random();

    @Tick(delay = 1L, unit = TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
    public void generate() throws InterruptedException {
      randomOutput.emit(random.nextInt(10000));
    }
  }

Building and Running the Application and Example
................................................

.. highlight:: console

In this remainder of this document, we refer to the CDAP runtime as "CDAP", and the
example code that is running on it as an "Application".

We show the Windows prompt as ``~SDK>`` to indicate a command prompt opened in the SDK directory.

In this example, you need to build the app from source and then deploy the compiled JAR file.
You start the CDAP, deploy the app, start the Flow and see the output.

When finished, stop the Application as described below.

Building the CountRandom Application
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

From the project root, build ``Purchase`` with the
`Apache Maven <http://maven.apache.org>`__ command::

	$ mvn clean package

(If you modify the code and would like to rebuild the Application, you can
skip the tests by using the command::

	$ mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean package

Deploying and Starting the Application
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Make sure an instance of the CDAP is running and available.
From within the SDK root directory, this command will start CDAP in local mode::

	$ ./bin/cdap.sh start

On Windows::

	~SDK> bin\cdap.bat start

From within the CDAP Console (`http://localhost:9999/ <http://localhost:9999/>`__ in local mode):

#. Drag and drop the Application .JAR file (``target/CountRandom-<version>.jar``)
   onto your browser window.
   Alternatively, use the *Load App* button found on the *Overview* of the CDAP Console.
#. Once loaded, select the ``CountRandom`` Application from the list.
   On the Application's detail page, click the *Start* button on the *Process* list.

On Windows:

#. To deploy the App JAR file, run ``~SDK> bin\app-manager.bat deploy`` or drag and drop the
   Application .JAR file (``target/CountRandom-<version>.jar`` onto your browser window.
   (Currently, the *Load App* button does not work under Windows.)
#. To start the App, run ``~SDK> bin\app-manager.bat start``

Viewing the Run:
++++++++++++++++

Once the flow ``source`` is started, you could see the stream count is '0', however the ``splitter`` would show the count of random numbers
received from the source and the ``counter`` will show the count of digits received.

Stopping the Application
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Either:

- On the Application detail page of the CDAP Console,
  click the *Stop* button on the *Process* list;

or:

- Run ``$ ./bin/app-manager.sh --action stop``

  On Windows, run ``~SDK> bin\app-manager.bat stop``
