Cask Data Application Platform Examples
=======================================

**Example Applications Demonstrating Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) Features**

Overview
========

We've selected three projects from our collection of examples to serve as
an introduction to the important features of the Cask Data Application Platform.

By reading, building and playing with these, you will look at these basic
elements of CDAP:

- Applications
- Streams
- Flows
- Flowlets
- Datasets
- Custom Datasets
- Batch Processing
- MapReduce

These examples (and more!) are included with our
`software development kit <http://cask.co/download>`__.

`Purchase <purchase.html>`_
=======================================================================
In this single example, we demonstrate all the different elements of CDAP:
Streams, Flow, Flowlets, Datasets, Queries, Procedures, MapReduce jobs, and Workflows 
in a single Application.
The application uses a scheduled MapReduce job and Workflow to read from one ObjectStore dataset
and write to another.

`SparkKMeans <sparkKMeans.html>`_
=======================================================================
This example shows another application of streaming analysis, computing the centers of points from an input stream using the KMeans Clustering method.

The application demonstrates using a **Spark** Program.

`SparkPageRank <sparkPageRank.html>`_
=======================================================================
This example shows another application of streaming analysis, computing the page rank based on information about backlink URLs.

The application demonstrates using a **Spark** Program.


Where to Go Next
================
Now that you've seen some examples using CDAP, take a look at:

- `Cask Data Application Platform Programming Guide <../programming.html>`__,
  an introduction to programming applications for CDAP.
