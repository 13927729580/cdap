CDAP Users’ Manual
==================================================

This CDAP Users’ Manual is for people who are using CDAP, and want to take advantage of its
abilities out-of-the-box to perform ETL (Extraction, Transformation and Loading) of data.

This is done by creating and operating an ETL Adapter. 

ETL Adapters are created from either of the two ETL Application Templates shipped with CDAP:

- ETL Batch
- ETL Realtime

Application Templates are built from Plugins. Application Templates are used to build CDAP
Adapters, of which one type is an ETL Adapter.

(If you are interested in writing your own Adapter, Application Template, Plugin, or
extending the existing ETL framework, please see these Developers’ Manual sections. [link])
