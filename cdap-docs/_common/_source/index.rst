.. rubric:: Introduction to the Cask Data Application Platform

The Cask |(TM)| Data Application Platform (CDAP) is an open source application development
platform for the Hadoop ecosystem that provides developers with data and application
virtualization to accelerate application development, address a broader range of real-time
and batch use cases, and deploy applications into production while satisfying enterprise
requirements.

CDAP is a layer of software running on top of Apache |(TM)| Hadoop |(R)| platforms such as the
Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub or the Hortonworks Data Platform. CDAP provides three essential components:

- Virtualization of data in the Hadoop environment through logical representations of underlying
  data;
- Virtualization of applications through application containers; and
- Services and tools that enable faster application creation in development and higher degrees of
  operational control in production.

CDAP exposes developer APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for creating applications
and accessing core CDAP services. CDAP defines and implements a diverse collection of services that land
applications and data on existing Hadoop infrastructure such as HBase, HDFS, YARN, MapReduce,
Hive, and Spark.

These documents are your complete manual to the Cask Data Application Platform: they help
you get started and set up your development environment; explain how CDAP works; and teach
how to develop and test CDAP applications.

It includes a complete reference to CDAP programming APIs and client interfaces, with instructions
on the installation, monitoring and diagnosing fully distributed CDAP in a Hadoop cluster.
