This section is to help you install the Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) on Hadoop
systems that are:

- Generic Apache Hadoop distributions; 
- CDH clusters *not managed* with Cloudera Manager; or
- HDP clusters *not managed* with Ambari.

Other distributions should be installed with our other :ref:`instructions <installation-index>`.

These instructions cover the steps to install, configure, and start CDAP. They assume
that you are familiar with Hadoop, and already have a cluster with it installed and running.
