    Setting-up CDAP Repos <am-1-setting-up>
    Adding Dependencies for CDAP <am-2-dependencies>
    Installing using Service Wizard <am-3-service-wizard>
    Upgrading CDAP <am-4-upgrading>
   
This section is to help you install CDAP on Hadoop systems that are `HDP (Hortonworks Data
Platform) <http://hortonworks.com/>`__ clusters managed with `Apache Ambari
<https://ambari.apache.org/>`__, the open source provisioning system for HDP.

You install CDAP into an HDP cluster by first adding the `CDAP Ambari Services
<https://github.com/caskdata/cdap-ambari-service>`__ to your Ambari Server. Once you have
restarted your Ambari Server, you will able to use the Ambari UI (Ambari Dashboard) to
install, start, and manage CDAP on HDP clusters.

These instructions assume that you are familiar with Apache Ambari and HDP, and already
have a cluster with them installed and running. The cluster must meet CDAP's
:ref:`hardware, network, and software requirements <admin-manual-system-requirements>`
before you install CDAP.

.. rubric:: Notes

- Apache Ambari can only be used to add CDAP to an **existing** Hadoop cluster, one
  that already has the required services (Hadoop: HDFS, YARN, HBase, ZooKeeper, and (optionally) Hive) installed.
- Ambari is for setting up HDP on bare clusters; it can't be used for clusters with HDP already installed, where the
  original installation was **not** with Ambari.
- Though you can install CDAP with Apache Ambari, you **cannot** currently use Ambari to upgrade CDAP. 
  Instead, please see :ref:`package-managers-upgrading`.
- A number of features are planned for the future, but are **not** currently included in the
  CDAP Apache Ambari Service:
  
  - `support for Kerberos-enabled clusters <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-4109>`__;
  - `integration with the CDAP Authentication Server <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-4110>`__;
  - `CDAP component high-availability support <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-4107>`__;
  - `pre-defined alerts for CDAP services <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-4106>`__;
  - `select CDAP metrics <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-4108>`__; and
  - `a full smoke test of CDAP functionality after installation <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-4105>`__.
