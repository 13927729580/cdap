This section is to help you install CDAP on Hadoop systems that are `CDH (Cloudera Data Hub)
<http://www.cloudera.com/content/www/en-us/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/
cdh_intro.html>`__ clusters managed with `Cloudera Manager (CM)
<http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/products-and-services/cloudera-enterprise/
cloudera-manager.html>`__.

You install CDAP into a CDH cluster by first downloading and installing a 
CSD (`Custom Service Descriptor <http://www.cloudera.com/content/www/en-us/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_mc_addon_services.html#concept_qbv_3jk_bn_unique_1>`__) 
for CDAP. Once the CDAP CSD is installed and you have restarted your Cloudera Manager Server, you
will able to use Cloudera Manager to install, start, and manage CDAP on CDH clusters.

These instructions assume that you are familiar with Cloudera Manager and CDH, and already
have a cluster managed by Cloudera Manager with CDH installed and running. The cluster must meet CDAP's
:ref:`hardware, network, and software requirements <admin-manual-system-requirements>`
before you install CDAP.
