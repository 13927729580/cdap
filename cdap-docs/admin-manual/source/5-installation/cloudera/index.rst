This section is to help you install the Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) on Hadoop
systems that are `CDH (Cloudera Data Hub) 
<http://www.cloudera.com/content/www/en-us/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cdh_intro.html>`__
clusters managed with `Cloudera Manager
<http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/products-and-services/cloudera-enterprise/cloudera-manager.html>`__.

You use Cloudera Manager to integrate CDAP into a Hadoop cluster by downloading and installing a 
CSD (`Custom Service Descriptor <http://www.cloudera.com/content/www/en-us/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_mc_addon_services.html#concept_qbv_3jk_bn_unique_1>`__) 
for CDAP. Once the CDAP CSD is installed and you have restarted your Cloudera Manager, you
will able to use Cloudera Manager to install, start, and manage CDAP on CDH clusters.

These instructions assume that you are familiar with Cloudera Manager and CDH, and already
have a cluster with it installed and running.
