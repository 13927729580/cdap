Manual Installation using Packages
==================================

.. include:: ../_includes/installation/installation-steps-images.txt

.. rubric:: Notes

This section describes installing CDAP on Hadoop clusters that are:

- Generic Apache Hadoop distributions; 
- CDH (Cloudera Data Hub) clusters *not managed* with Cloudera Manager; or
- HDP (Hortonworks Data Platform) clusters *not managed* with Apache Ambari.

Cloudera Manager (CDH), Apache Ambari (HDP), and MapR distributions should be installed
with our other :ref:`distribution instructions <installation-index>`.

Preparing the Cluster
=============================
Please review the :ref:`Software Prerequisites <admin-manual-software-requirements>`, 
as a configured Hadoop, HBase, and Hive (plus an optional Spark client) needs to be configured on the
node(s) where CDAP will run.

CDAP HA setup
-------------
Repeat the installation steps on additional boxes. The configuration settings (in
``cdap-site.xml``, *property:value*) needed to support high-availability are:

- ``kafka.seed.brokers``: ``127.0.0.1:9092,.../${root.namespace}`` 
  
  - Kafka brokers list (comma-separated), followed by ``/${root.namespace}``
  
- ``kafka.default.replication.factor``: 2

  - Used to replicate Kafka messages across multiple machines to prevent data loss in 
    the event of a hardware failure.
  - The recommended setting is to run at least two Kafka servers.
  - Set this to the number of Kafka servers.
