=============================
Package Managers (RPM/Debian)
=============================

This section describes installing CDAP on Hadoop clusters that are:

- Generic Apache Hadoop distributions; 
- CDH clusters *not managed* with Cloudera Manager; or
- HDP clusters *not managed* with Apache Ambari.

Cloudera Manager (CDH), Apache Ambari (HDP), and MapR distributions should be installed
with our other :ref:`distribution instructions <installation-index>`.

These instructions cover the steps to install, configure, and start CDAP. They assume
that you are familiar with Hadoop, and already have a cluster with it installed and running.
The cluster must meet CDAP's :ref:`hardware, network, and software requirements
<admin-manual-system-requirements>` before you install CDAP.

Follow these steps:

Once you have completed the installation and started CDAP services,
you can then :ref:`verify the installation <admin-manual-verification>`.


Setting Up the Cluster
======================
Please review the :ref:`Software Prerequisites <admin-manual-software-requirements>`, 
as a configured Hadoop, HBase, and Hive (plus an optional Spark client) needs to be configured on the
node(s) where CDAP will run. :ref:`Node.js <admin-manual-software-requirements>` is required on all
nodes where CDAP services run.
