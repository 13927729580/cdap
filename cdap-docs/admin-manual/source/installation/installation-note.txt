.. topic:: Different ways to install CDAP

  There are different ways to install CDAP, depending if it is a distributed or standalone system:

  - For **CDH (Cloudera)**, you can follow :ref:`these instructions <cloudera-configuring>` using Cloudera Manager.

  - For **HDP (Hortonworks)**, you can follow :ref:`these instructions <ambari-configuring>` using Apache Ambari.

  - For **MapR**, you can follow :ref:`these notes <mapr-configuring>`.

  - On **other Apache Hadoop distributions**, you can follow the manual method referenced below on this page, 
    using either our :ref:`quick start installation instructions
    <installation-quick-start>` or by following our :ref:`general installation
    instructions <install>`. Use the general instructions if you have either an unusual
    situation |---| such as HA (high availability) |---| or would like more details on the
    steps and the available options.

  - For installing **our SDK (standalone system)**, we have :ref:`separate instructions <standalone-index>`.
