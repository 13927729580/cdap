Logging and Monitoring
======================

Logs and Metrics
================
CDAP collects logs and metrics for all of its internal services and and user applications.
Being able to view these details can be very helpful in debugging CDAP applications as
well as analyzing their performance. CDAP gives access to its logs, metrics, and other
monitoring information through RESTful APIs as well as a Java Client.

See the :ref:`Logging <http-restful-api-logging>`, :ref:`Metrics <http-restful-api-metrics>`, 
and :ref:`Monitoring <http-restful-api-monitor>` HTTP RESTful APIs, the :ref:`Java Client
<reference:java-client-api>`, :ref:`master-service-logging-configuration`, and the 
:ref:`application-logback` for additional information.


Log Location of CDAP System Services
====================================
The location of CDAP system service logs depends on the mode of CDAP and the Hadoop distribution.

- With **Standalone CDAP** (the CDAP SDK), system logs are located in ``<CDAP-SDK-HOME>/logs``.

- For **Distributed CDAP**, with the exception of Cloudera Manager, system logs are located in
  ``/var/log/cdap``. With Cloudera Manager installations, system log files are located in
  directories under ``/var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process``.

These logs are emitted by the CDAP System Services:

- CDAP Master
- CDAP Router
- CDAP UI
- CDAP Auth Server
- CDAP Kafka Server


Application Logging Messages
============================

.. highlight:: java

CDAP supports logging through standard `SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java)
<http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html>`__ APIs. For instance, in a flowlet you can write::

  private static Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(WordCounter.class);
  ...
  @ProcessInput
  public void process(String line) {
    LOG.info("{}: Received line {}", this.getContext().getTransactionAwareName(), line);
    ... // processing
    LOG.info("{}: Emitting count {}", this.getContext().getTransactionAwareName(), wordCount);
    output.emit(wordCount);
  }

The log messages emitted by your application code can be viewed in different ways.

- Using the :ref:`restful-api`. The :ref:`Logging HTTP RESTful API <http-restful-api-logging>` 
  details the available contexts that can be called to retrieve different messages.
- Log messages of an application can be viewed in the :ref:`CDAP UI <cdap-ui>`
  by clicking the *Logs* tab of an application.
  
Application logs are stored in locations specified by properties in the
:ref:`cdap-site.xml <appendix-cdap-default-logging>` file:

- For CDAP Standalone: the property ``log.collection.root`` (default
  ``${local.data.dir}/logs``) is the root location for collecting logs when in Standalone
  CDAP.

- For Distributed CDAP: tbd




.. _master-service-logging-configuration:

Master Service Logging Configuration
====================================

:term:`Master Services <master services>` use ``logback-container.xml``, packaged with the CDAP distribution,
for logging configuration. This logback does log rotation once a day at midnight and expires logs older than
14 days. Changes can be made to ``logback-container.xml``; afterwards, the ``cdap-master``
process will need to be restarted for the modified logback to take effect.


Monitoring Utilities
====================
CDAP can be monitored using external systems such as `Nagios <https://www.nagios.org/>`__; a Nagios-style plugin 
`is available <https://github.com/caskdata/cdap-monitoring-tools/blob/develop/nagios/README.rst>`__
for checking the status of CDAP applications, programs, and the CDAP instance itself.
