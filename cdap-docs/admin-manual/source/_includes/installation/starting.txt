|display-distribution|: Starting Services
=============================================================

.. highlight:: console

When all the packages and dependencies have been installed, and the configuration
parameters set, you can start the services on each of the CDAP boxes by running the
command::

  $ for i in `ls /etc/init.d/ | grep cdap` ; do sudo service $i start ; done

When all the services have completed starting, the CDAP UI should then be
accessible through a browser at port ``9999``. 

The URL will be ``http://<host>:9999`` where ``<host>`` is the IP address of
one of the machines where you installed the packages and started the services.


.. _|distribution|-highly-available:

.. rubric:: Making CDAP Highly-Available

Repeat these steps on additional boxes.  The configurations needed to support high-availability are:

- ``kafka.seed.brokers``: ``127.0.0.1:9092,...`` 
  
  - Kafka brokers list (comma separated)
  
- ``kafka.default.replication.factor``: 2

  - Used to replicate Kafka messages across multiple machines to prevent data loss in 
    the event of a hardware failure.
  - The recommended setting is to run at least two Kafka servers.
  - Set this to the number of Kafka servers.
