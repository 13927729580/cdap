An *Artifact* is a JAR file that contains Java classes and resources required to create and run an *Application*.
*Artifacts* are identified by a name, version, and scope. Once added to CDAP, an *Artifact* cannot be modified,
unless it is a SNAPSHOT artifact. An *Artifact* is a SNAPSHOT artifact if its version begins with SNAPSHOT.
