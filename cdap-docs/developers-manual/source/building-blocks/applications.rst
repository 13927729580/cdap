.. highlight:: java

An **application** is a collection of building blocks that read and write data through the data
abstraction layer in CDAP. 

**Applications** are composed from *programs,* *services,* and *schedules*.

Programs include :doc:`flows <flows-flowlets/index>`, :doc:`MapReduce programs <mapreduce-programs>`,
:doc:`workflows <workflows>`, :doc:`Spark programs <spark-programs>`, and :doc:`workers <workers>` are used to process
data. :doc:`Services <services>` are used to serve data.

**Data abstractions** include :doc:`streams <streams>` and :doc:`datasets <datasets/index>`.

.. rubric:: Creating an Application with an Application Specification

To create an application, implement the ``Application`` interface or subclass from
``AbstractApplication`` class, specifying the application metadata and declaring and
configuring each of the application components::

      public class MyApp extends AbstractApplication {
        @Override
        public void configure() {
          setName("myApp");
          setDescription("My Sample Application");
          addStream(new Stream("myAppStream"));
          createDataset("myAppDataset", Table.class);
          addFlow(new MyAppFlow());
          addService(new MyService());
          addMapReduce(new MyMapReduce());
          addWorkflow(new MyAppWorkflow());
        }
      }

Notice that *streams* are defined using the provided ``Stream`` class, and *datasets* are
defined by passing a ``Table`` class; both are referenced by name.

Other components are defined using user-written classes that implement correspondent
interfaces and are referenced by passing an object, in addition to being assigned a unique
name.

Names used for *streams* and *datasets* need to be unique across the CDAP instance, while
names used for *programs* and *services* need to be unique only to the application.

.. rubric:: A Typical CDAP Application

A typical design of a CDAP application consists of:

- streams to ingest data into CDAP;
- flows, consisting of flowlets linked together, to process the ingested data
  in real time or batch;
- MapReduce programs, Spark programs, and workflows for batch processing tasks;
- workers for processing data in an ad-hoc manner that doesn't fit into real time or batch paradigms
- datasets for storage of data, either raw or the processed results; and
- services for serving data and processed results.

Of course, not all components are required: it depends on the application. A minimal
application could include a stream, a flow, a flowlet, and a dataset. It's possible a
stream is not needed, if other methods of bringing in data are used. In the next pages,
we'll look at these components, and their interactions.
