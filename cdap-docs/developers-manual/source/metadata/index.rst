*Metadata* is an important capability of CDAP. CDAP Metadata helps show how datasets and
programs are related to each other and helps in understanding the impact of a change
before the change is made.

These features provide full visibility into the impact of changes while providing an audit
trail of access to datasets by programs and applications. Together, they give a clear view
when identifying trusted data sources and enable the ability to track the trail of
sensitive data.

CDAP captures metadata from many different sources |---| as well as those specified by a
user |---| on different entities and objects. The container model of CDAP provides for the
seamless aggregation of a wide variety of machine-generated metadata that is automatically
associated with datasets. This gives developers and data scientists flexibility when
innovating and building solutions on Hadoop, without the worry of maintaining compliance
and governance for every application.

CDAP metadata |---| consisting of **properties** (a list of key-value pairs) or **tags** (a
list of keys) |---| can be used to annotate artifacts, applications, programs, datasets,
streams, and views.

Using the CDAP :ref:`Metadata HTTP RESTful API <http-restful-api-metadata>`, you can set,
retrieve, and delete these metadata annotations.

Metadata keys, values, and tags must conform to the CDAP :ref:`supported characters 
<supported-characters>`, and are limited to 50 characters in length. The entire metadata
object associated with a single entity is limited to 10K bytes in size.

CDAP Metadata can be pushed to Cloudera Navigator for metadata discovery and search. 
Refer to :ref:`Cloudera Navigator Integration <navigator-integration>` for more information.
