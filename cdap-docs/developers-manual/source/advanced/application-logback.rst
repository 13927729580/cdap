CDAP Logging Framework
======================

.. highlight:: console

CDAP collects logs of both its internal services and user applications. To do so, CDAP
uses a logging framework consisting of *appenders* and *logging pipelines*:

- **An appender** is a Java class, responsible for writing log events to persistent storage and
  maintaining metadata about that storage.  
  CDAP implements a ``RollingLocationLogAppender`` class that <tbd>.
  To create an appender, implement the <> and <> interfaces.

- **A logging pipeline** is a single-threaded process that reads log events from Kafka and invokes
  the appender defined in its configuration.

The framework is configured using ``logback.xml`` files at a specified location. For every file
configured, a separate logging pipeline is created, providing isolation from other logging pipelines:

Default Configuration
=====================
In the default configuration, CDAP uses ...
For many cases, this may be sufficient.

.. highlight:: xml

Example ``logback.xml`` file::

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <configuration>
    <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
      <encoder>
        <pattern>%d{ISO8601} - %-5p [%t:%C{1}@%L] - %m%n</pattern>
      </encoder>
    </appender>

    <property name="cdap.log.saver.instance.id" value="instanceId"/>

    <appender name="rollingAppender" class="co.cask.cdap.logging.plugins.RollingLocationLogAppender">
  
      <!-- log file path will be created by the appender as: <basePath>/<namespace-id>/<application-id>/<filePath> -->
      <basePath>plugins/applogs</basePath>
      <filePath>securityLogs/logFile-${cdap.log.saver.instance.id}.log</filePath>
    
      <!-- cdap is the owner of the log files directory, so cdap will get read/write/execute permissions.
      Log files will be read-only for others. -->
      <dirPermissions>744</dirPermissions>
    
      <!-- cdap is the owner of the log files, so cdap will get read/write permissions.
      Log files will be read-only for others -->
      <filePermissions>644</filePermissions>

      <!-- It is an optional parameter, which takes number of miliseconds.
      Appender will close a file if it is not modified for fileMaxInactiveTimeMs
      period of time. Here it is set for thirty minutes. -->
      <fileMaxInactiveTimeMs>1800000</fileMaxInactiveTimeMs>

      <rollingPolicy class="co.cask.cdap.logging.plugins.FixedWindowRollingPolicy">
        <!-- Only specify the file name without a directory, as the appender will use the
        appropriate directory specified in filePath -->
        <fileNamePattern>logFile-${cdap.log.saver.instance.id}.log.%i</fileNamePattern>
        <minIndex>1</minIndex>
        <maxIndex>9</maxIndex>
      </rollingPolicy>

      <triggeringPolicy class="co.cask.cdap.logging.plugins.SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy">
        <!-- Set the maximum file size appropriately to avoid a large number of small files -->
        <maxFileSize>100MB</maxFileSize>
      </triggeringPolicy>

      <encoder>
        <pattern>%-4relative [%thread] %-5level %logger{35} - %msg%n</pattern>
        <!-- Do not flush on every event -->
        <immediateFlush>false</immediateFlush>
      </encoder>
    </appender>

    <logger name="co.cask.cdap.logging.plugins.RollingLocationLogAppenderTest" level="INFO">
      <appender-ref ref="rollingAppender"/>
    </logger>

    <root level="INFO">
      <appender-ref ref="STDOUT"/>
    </root>

  </configuration>


Custom Logging Pipeline
=======================
For a custom logging pipeline, you can take the previous example ``logback.xml`` file,
modify it,and place it in the <>. 

For every file configured, a separate logging pipeline is created. Though CDAP has been
tested with multiple logging pipelines and appenders, the fewer of each that are specified
will provide better performance.


Custom Appender
===============
If you need an appender beyond what is offered here, you can write and implement your own
custom appender. See the Logback documentation at
https://logback.qos.ch/manual/appenders.html for information on how to do this.





.. _application-logback:

Application Logback
===================

YARN containers launched by a CDAP application use a default container logback file
|---| ``logback-container.xml`` |---| packaged with CDAP and installed in 
the CDAP :ref:`configuration directory <admin-manual-cdap-components>`. This logback does
log rotation once every day at midnight and deletes logs older than 14 days. Depending on
the use case, the default configuration may be sufficient. As long as the container is
running, these policies will apply. (As the lifetime of many containers is often less than
14 days, these limits may never be reached.)

**Note:** In the case of the CDAP Standalone, the logback used is ``logback.xml``, located
in the ``<cdap-sdk-home>/conf`` directory.

You can specify a custom ``logback.xml`` for a CDAP application by packaging
it with the application in the application's ``src/main/resources`` directory.
The packaged ``logback.xml`` is then used for each container launched by the application.

To write a custom ``logback.xml``, refer to the `Logback manual <http://logback.qos.ch/manual>`__
for information.

**Note:** When a custom ``logback.xml`` is specified for an application, the custom
``logback.xml`` will be used in place of the ``logback-container.xml``. A custom
``logback.xml`` needs to be configured for log rotation (``rollingPolicy``) and log
clean-up (``maxHistory``) to ensure that long-running containers don't fill up the disk.
