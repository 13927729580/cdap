CDAP FAQ: User Interface
========================

Does CDAP support CORS?
-----------------------
CORS (`Cross-Origin Resource Sharing <http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/>`__) is 
currently not supported in CDAP. 

If you were interested in using CORS to create a webapp that showed information about CDAP
gathered through the RESTful APIs, a workaround would be the method used for the CDAP-UI.
Make backend requests through a NodeJS server and route the response to the client
browser. Here, the NodeJS server acts as a proxy and from it you can call the CDAP RESTful
end points without any issues of cross-domain.
