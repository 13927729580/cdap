System Requirements and Dependencies
============================================

The CDAP SDK runs on Linux, MacOS and Windows, and has three requirements:

- `JDK 6 or JDK 7 <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`__ 
  (required to run CDAP; note that $JAVA_HOME should be set)
- `Node.js 0.8.16+ <http://nodejs.org>`__ (required to run the CDAP Console UI)
- `Apache Maven 3.0+ <http://maven.apache.org>`__ (required to build CDAP applications)

We recommend using an IDE when building CDAP applications, such as either `IntelliJ
<https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/>`__ or `Eclipse, <https://www.eclipse.org/>`__ as
described in the section on :ref:`development environment setup. <dev-env>`
