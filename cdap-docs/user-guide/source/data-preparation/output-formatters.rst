Write as CSV

#
Write as CSV

WRITE-AS-CSV directive converts the record into CSV.

## Syntax
```
write-as-csv <column>
```

```column``` will contain the CSV representation of the record.

## Usage Notes

The WRITE-AS-CSV directive provides an easy way to convert the record
into a CSV. If the ```column``` already exists, it will overwrite it.


## Example

Let's consider a very simple record
```
{
"int" : 1,
"string" : "this is string",
}
```

running the directive
```
write-as-csv body
```

would generate the following record

```
{
"body" : "1,\"this is, string\",
"int" : 1,
"string" : "this is, string",
}
```


.. _user-guide-data-preparation-write-as-a-json-map:

Write as a JSON Map
===================

#
Write as JSON Map

WRITE-AS-JSON-MAP directive converts the record into JSON Map.

## Syntax
```
write-as-json <column>
```

```column``` will contain the JSON of the fields in the record.

## Usage Notes

The WRITE-AS-JSON-MAP directive provides an easy way to convert the record
into a JSON. If the ```column``` already exists, it will overwrite it.

Depending on the type of the object the field is holding it will be transformed
appropriately.

## Example

Let's consider a very simple record
```
{
"int" : 1,
"string" : "this is string",
}
```

running the directive
```
write-as-json-map body
```

would generate the following record

```
{
"body" : "[{"key": "int", "value" : "1"}, {"key" : "string", "value" : "this is string"} ]"
"int" : 1,
"string" : "this is string",
}
```
