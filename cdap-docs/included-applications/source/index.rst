CDAP Included Applications 
==========================


.. _included-apps-intro:

.. rubric:: Introduction to Included Applications

.. CDAP allows developers to create distributed applications using the foundational
.. application building blocks (datasets, streams, flows, MapReduce, services, workflows and
.. workers). However, there are use cases that require that a similar type of action be
.. performed in different circumstances, differing only slightly in each case. 
.. 
.. For example, perhaps you need to copy data from five different relational tables to CDAP
.. Datasets periodically; you wouldn't want to deploy five different applications to
.. perform these tasks. Instead, you would want to reuse code or a common program that can be
.. configured to perform similar actions on differently configured data sources. In situations
.. like these, you can create or use an *Application Template*.
.. 
.. An **Application Template** is an application that is reusable through configuration and
.. extensible through plugins. Plugins extend the application template by implementing an
.. interface expected by the template. One or more plugins are packaged in a specifically
.. constructed JAR file.
.. 
.. To create an instantiation of an application template |---| called an **Adapter** |---| you
.. can make a RESTful call, use a CLI command, or use the CDAP UI, providing the
.. configuration at the time. Users of CDAP manage the lifecycle of an adapter in a very
.. similar manner to managing the life cycle of a CDAP program.

CDAP comes packaged with several system artifacts to create two types of applications: **ETL
(Extract, Transform, and Load) pipelines** and **Data Quality applications**, simply by
configuring the system artifacts and not writing any code at all.

An application created from a configured system artifact following the ETL pattern is
referred to (interchangeably) as an *ETL pipeline* or *ETL application*. Similarly, an
application built following the Data Quality pattern are referred to as a *Data Quality
application*.

In the future, a variety of system artifacts will be delivered. The framework is
extensible: users can write their own artifacts if they so chose, and can
manage the lifecycle of their custom applications using CDAP.


.. rubric:: ETL 

ETL is **Extract**, **Transform** and **Load** of data, a common first-step in any data
application. CDAP endeavors to make performing ETL possible out-of-box without writing
code; instead, you just configure CDAP appropriately and operate it.
