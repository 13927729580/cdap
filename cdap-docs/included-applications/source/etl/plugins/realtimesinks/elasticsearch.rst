Real-time Sinks: Elasticsearch
===============================

.. rubric:: Description

CDAP Elasticsearch Batch Sink takes the structured record from the input source and
converts it to a JSON string, then indexes it in Elasticsearch using the index, type, and
id specified by the user. The Elasticsearch server should be running prior to creating the
application.

.. rubric:: Use Case

This sink is used whenever you need to write to an Elasticsearch server.

.. rubric:: Properties

**index:** The name of the index where the data will be stored If the index does not
already exist, it will be created using Elasticsearch's default properties.

**type:** The name of the type where the data will be stored. If it does not already
exist, it will be created.

**idField:** The field that will determine the id for the document. It should match a fieldname
in the structured record of the input.

**hostname:** The hostname and port for the Elasticsearch server; such as localhost:9200.
