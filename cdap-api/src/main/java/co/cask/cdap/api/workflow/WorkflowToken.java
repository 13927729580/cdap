   * inserted in the WorkflowToken for a specific key except in the case of fork
   * and join. In case of fork in the Workflow, copies of the WorkflowToken are made
   * and passed it along the each branch. At the join, all copies of the
   * WorkflowToken are merged together. While merging, the values from the branch
   * that was completed first will be added first to the WorkflowToken.
   *
   * Example: Consider that the following values were added to the Workflow
   * for the key "myKey". Numbers associated with the values represent
   * unique node names -
   *
   *                3   4

   *                5   6
   *
   * Assume that the branch containing node 5 finishes the execution first.
   *
   * Now the method invocation getValues("myKey") will return the list
   * in which the keys will be ordered as 0-1-2-5-6-3-4-7-8.
