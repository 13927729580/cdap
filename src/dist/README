================================================================================

AppFabric Developer Edition is a fully functioning stand alone edition of the
Continuuity AppFabric platform. You can use this edition to write, debug and
test your BigData applications, before deploying to the Continuuity Cloud
Platform.

Installation
============

To install and use AppFabric and the included examples there are a few simple
pre-requisite requirements:

  1. Java 1.6+ (required to run AppFabric, note: $JAVA_HOME should be set)
  2. Node.js 0.8.1+ (required to run the AppFabric UI)
  3. Ant 1.8+ (required to build the example applications)

Once you have installed the prerequisites, you should unzip the AppFabric
distribution to a suitable directory. E.g.

  %> cd ~/Projects
  %> unzip /tmp/continuuity-developer-edition-1.2.0-beta.zip

You are now ready to start AppFabric. Do so by running the
'continuuity-app-fabric' script in the $APP_FABRIC_DIR/bin folder. E.g.

  %> cd ~/Projects/continuuity-developer-edition-1.2.0-beta
  %> bin/continuuity-app-fabric
