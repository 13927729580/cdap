================================================================================

Continuuity Developer Suite is a fully functioning single node edition of the 
Continuuity AppFabric runtime. You can use this edition to write, debug and
test your BigData applications, before deploying to the Continuuity Cloud.

Installation
============

To install and use AppFabric and the included examples there are a few simple
pre-requisite requirements:

  1. Java 1.6+ (required to run AppFabric, note: $JAVA_HOME should be set)
  2. Node.js 0.8.1+ (required to run the AppFabric UI)
  3. Ant 1.8+ (required to build the example applications)

Once you have installed the prerequisites, you should unzip the Developer Suite
distribution to a suitable directory. E.g.

  %> cd ~/Projects
  %> unzip /tmp/continuuity-developer-suite-1.4.0.zip

You are now ready to start AppFabric. Do so by running the
'continuuity-app-fabric' script in the $CONTINUUITY/bin folder. E.g.

  %> cd ~/Projects/continuuity-developer-suite-1.4.0
  %> bin/continuuity-app-fabric start
