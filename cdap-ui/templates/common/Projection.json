This is a comma separated list of key-value pairs, where each pair is separated by a colon and specifies the field name and the desired type. For example: 'count:long,price:double' specifies that the 'count' field should be converted to a long and the 'price' field should be converted to a double. Only simple types are supported (boolean, int, long, float, double, bytes, string). Any simple type can be converted to bytes or a string. Otherwise, a type can only be converted to a larger type. For example, an int can be converted to a long, but a long cannot be converted to an int."
