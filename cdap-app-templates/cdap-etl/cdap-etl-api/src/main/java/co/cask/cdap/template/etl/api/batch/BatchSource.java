 * subsequent transforms. By default, the value of the key value pair will be emitted.
 *
 * {@link BatchSource#initialize}, {@link BatchSource#transform} and {@link BatchSource#destroy} methods are called
 * inside the Batch Run while {@link BatchSource#prepareRun} and {@link BatchSource#onRunFinish} methods are called
 * on the client side, which launches the Batch run, before the Batch run starts and after it finishes respectively.
